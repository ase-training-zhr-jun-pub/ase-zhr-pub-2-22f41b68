# Dependencies

- always add `Lombok` and its annotation processor to the project
- always add `MapStruct` and its annotation processor to the project

# General

The backend uses Spring Boot as main technology.
The following guardrails need to be followed:

- use Spring Boot BOM instead of Spring Maven parent based approach
- use functional or feature based packaging approach instead of tiered/layered packaging
- user yaml style property files

# APIs

- use `@ResponseStatus` annotation for custom exceptions
- use MapStruct via Spring injection as mapping layer for database entities to response entities
